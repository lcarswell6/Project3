HEROKU:

What I'm hoping to do with this project is to make a simple
"shop and buy" app where a user logs in and is able to view products, place those products in a cart and (eventually) purchase. User should be fully editable with update delete and add functions. Hope to build on to this app in the future to make it similar to a shope for me  service for buying retail items, so I'll eventually need to have addresses and cancellation functions as well.
